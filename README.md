# csgo_ext
 Basic external cheat for csgo using winapi RPM/WPM. 
 
 The HWID check is really ghetto and you are better off with checking more than just HDDs.. also storing them inside the cheat is not a good idea but this was just for learning purposes so I leave it as it is
 
 Figure out your own way to acces memory safer :) Currently its fine but its stupid to leave open handle to a process
